Behavioral-based XP awards


In a behavioral-based XP system, a player is rewarded for taking action that makes the game more enjoyable for everyone. Generally, a DM should award players 1 to 3 XP per session based on a handful of options. 

Recommended Awards:

Participation 1 XP

This includes; showing up on time, being prepared, keeping OOC chatters to a minimum, and not distracting the party for the goal of playing the game. 

This is the absolute minimum a player should earn. If they showed up and actually played, they get 1 XP. 

Good roleplay 1 XP
 
This award can include but is not limited to staying in character, purposefully ignoring OOC knowledge, a strong preference for working with the party, and leaning into the plot.    

This award should be very common. If a DM enjoyed their time with this player, they probably deserve this point. 


Optional Awards:

Outstanding moment 1 XP

This player has done something so memorable it should be recognized. It could be funny RP, spectacularly succeeding or failing a task or even an ingenious solution to a problem. This award should be given out rarely.


Notetaker 1 XP

The notetaker has taken on the job of keeping track of the minutia of the game. This is typically a thankless task and should be consistently rewarded if done well. This XP should be awarded at the beginning of every game when the notetaker's notes are read to the group as part of a recap. 



Support staff 1 XP

There are logistics involved in running a game. Maybe that’s setting up and breaking down tables; maybe it’s being in charge of the snacks, or the Calendar invite, or a tech support role for virtual games. Consistent effort should be consistently rewarded. 


Milestones 3+ XP

Additional XP can be awarded for reaching significant milestones. This should l be a rare event, and your players should be leveling based on consistently good play.
